### This lab requires starting from the main [APM Instrumentation Workshop](../workshop-steps/3-workshop-labs.md)

It is recommended to do each step in a separate terminal.
***
## Step #1 Set up environment and run Python Flask server using auto-instrumentation

```
cd ~/apmworkshop/apm/python
source run-server.sh
```

You will see the server startup text when this is run.
***
## Step #2 Run the client python app via the `splk-py-trace` command to send requests to the Flask server

Open a new terminal window to your Linux instance and run the Python client to sent POST requests to the Flask server.

```
cd ~/apmworkshop/apm/python
source run-client.sh
```

The `python-requests.py` client will make calls to the flask server with a random short sleep time.
You can stop the requests with `ctrl-c`
***
## Step #3 Check OpenTelemetry Collector Statistics to see that spans are being sent

Open a new terminal window to your Linux instance (or use `tmux` and run in separate pane)

`lynx localhost:55679/debug/tracez` will show the metrics and spans being gathered and sent by the Collector.  

Lynx is a text browser that was installed during with the `setup-tools`. Enabling a web browser to access your environment will allow for a full web GUI.

## Step #4 Traces / services will now be viewable in the APM dashboard

A new service takes about 90 seconds to register for the first time, and then all data will be available in real time.  
Additionally span IDs will print in the terminal where flask-server.py is running.  
You can use `ctrl-c` to stop the requests and server any time.  

Navigate to `Splunk Overvability -> APM`

Try the Tag Spotlight view of Span Tags  
***
## Step #5 Where is the auto-instrumentation?

The `run-server.sh` and `run-client.sh` scripts set up the environment variables for OpenTelemetry and invoke the Python auto instrumentation:  

`splk-py-trace` is the auto instrumenting function that runs Python3 with the instrumentation that automatically emits spans from the Python app. No code changes are necessary.

Splunk Observability Cloud has a `Getting Data In` Wizard to guide through instrumentation setup.

OpenTelemetry repo for python is here: https://github.com/signalfx/splunk-otel-python
***
## Step #6 Leave the Flask server running

You'll need need this process for the next client examples in the workshop.  

You can now go to the next step of [APM Instrumentation Workshop Labs](../workshop-steps/3-workshop-labs.md)
