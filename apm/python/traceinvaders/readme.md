# Python Trace Invaders by Splunk and OpenTelemetry

<img src="./screenshot.png" width="640">

## Defeat the aliens who are sending error spans by shooting them- each successful shot sends a healthy request!
## With sound!

This game showcases [OpenTelemetry Manual Python Instrumentation](https://opentelemetry-python.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

TraceInvaders runs on MacOS w/ sound effects and Windows w/o sound effects. On Windows you'll need to manually set the environment variables that `setup.sh` creates

A Splunk APM account is required but the Splunk APM or Infrastructure agent is not.

### Step #1

Make sure you have python3 set up on your Mac and its path is correct such that `python3` command works.  

Set up your Mac for Splunk Python OpenTelemetry:

#### Create a new isolated virtual environment and activate it

This will ensure your packages will not conflict with systems packages and not break other projects/apps.

```bash
python3 -m venv venv && \
source venv/bin/activate
```
Use `. venv/bin/activate.fish` if you're using fish shell.

#### Setup your new virtual environment
```bash
pip install --upgrade pip && \
pip install wheel && \
pip install splunk-opentelemetry && \
splk-py-trace-bootstrap
```

### Step #2

Set up your Splunk APM REALM and TOKEN by editing: `setup.sh` and then run the setup script: `source setup.sh`

### Step #3 Run Game

To run game: `source startgame.sh`

Note- the game will still run if not connected to Splunk APM.

### Instructions ###

**Instructions**

The Splunk APM Service Dashboard for TraceInvaders shows a req/sec every time you hit an alien.

Every time the aliens advance downwards towards you, an error span is generated.
The goal is to keep the reqs/sec high and the error spans at zero.

Exit by closing game window or ctrl-c in terminal.

**Troubleshooting**

If you see this in your terminal during gameplay `ConnectionRefusedError: [Errno 61] Connection refused` then recheck your Splunk Realm and Token in the `setup.sh` script and re-run it.
